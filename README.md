# pagopa-selfcare-backoffice-scheduler
This repository details the implementation of a scheduler component within the Backoffice pagoPA system. Its core function is to autonomously execute scheduled operations requested by users (for example processes the planned deletion of IBANs on a future date specified by the Creditor Entity, ensuring the automation of this administrative task).
